	An abstraction layer to let code easily switch between different

	from :mod:`concurrent.futures` directly.

	It also serves as a compatibility shim to make us compatible with
	gevent thread patching. For that reason, we avoid throwing any
	exceptions and instead return them, meaning that the caller should
	be prepared to get Exception objects in the results. This also
	means that for the multiprocessing case, the thrown exception
	needs to be properly pickleable. (Throwing exceptions from the
	called function is not safe in the multiprocessing case and can
	hang the pool, and has undefined results in the thread case.)
