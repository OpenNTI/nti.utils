	"""
	A generic (and therefore relatively expensive)
	:class:`transaction.interfaces.IDataManager` that invokes a
	callable (usually a method of an object) when the transaction
	finishes successfully. The method should not raise exceptions when
	invoked, as they will be caught and ignored (to preserve
	consistency with the rest of the data managers). If there's a
	chance the method could fail, then whatever actions it does take
	should not have side-effects.

	These data managers have no guaranteed relationship to other data
	managers in terms of the order of which they commit, except as
	documented with :meth:`sortKey`.

	Because these data managers execute exactly one operation on a
	complete transaction commit, implementing a savepoint is trivial:
	do nothing when it is rolled back. A savepoint is created to checkpoint
	a transaction and rolled back to reverse actions taken *after* the
	checkpoint. Only data managers that were active (joined) at the
	time the transaction savepoint is created are asked to create
	their own savepoint, and then potentially to roll it back. We do
	no work until the transaction is committed, so we have nothing
	to rollback. Moroever, if a transaction savepoint is activated
	before a manager joins, then that manager is not asked for its own
	savepoint: it is simply aborted and unjoined from the transaction if
	the previos savepoint is rolledback.
